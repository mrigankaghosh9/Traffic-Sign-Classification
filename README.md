# Traffic-Sign-Classification

In this project Convulational Neural Network has been used to build train and test a traffic sign classification model.

Tensorflow & keras has been used.

It is a multiclass classification problem.

# Steps to solve the problem

1> Finding data on kaggle and loading it into google collab

2> Preprocessing the images and visualizing them

3> Finding out the mean of the dimensions and resizing all the images accordingly

4> Converting the images into numpy array and normalize them

5> Checking class imbalance

6> Splitting the data and performing one-hot encoding

7> Creating the model architecture, compiling the model and then fitting it

8> Plotting the accuracy and loss against each epoch

9> Preprocessing the test data and make predictions on it 

10> Visualizing the original and predicted labels for the test image.
